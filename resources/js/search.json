In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the need for highly responsive, interactive, and efficient web applications is paramount. As developers, we constantly seek ways to streamline our workflows, improve user experiences, and optimize performance. HTMX is an innovative tool that allows us to achieve these goals by enabling a more seamless interaction between client and server without the complexity of single-page applications (SPAs).","HTMX, or Hypertext Markup Extensions, is a modern JavaScript library that empowers you to build dynamic and interactive web pages with minimal JavaScript. Unlike traditional SPAs, which often require substantial front-end frameworks and can be cumbersome to manage, HTMX allows you to keep your focus on server-side logic while still delivering a rich, interactive experience to your users. This workshop will explore how HTMX can be integrated into your existing ASP.NET Razor Pages applications, providing a pragmatic approach to developing feature-rich web applications without sacrificing simplicity and maintainability.","Throughout this workshop, we will explore the core concepts of HTMX and how it can enhance Razor Pages by adding dynamic content loading, seamless form submissions, and real-time updates—all without needing to write excessive JavaScript. We'll examine how HTMX's declarative approach aligns with the principles of server-side development, making it a perfect fit for ASP.NET developers looking to modernize their web applications while maintaining control over their server-side code.","By the end of this workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement HTMX in your projects, allowing you to create faster, more responsive web applications with a fraction of the effort typically associated with modern front-end development. Whether you're looking to improve existing Razor Pages applications or start new projects with an eye toward simplicity and performance, this workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools to do so effectively.","We are excited to have you join us in enhancing your web development skills. We look forward to exploring the powerful combination of HTMX and ASP.NET Razor Pages. Let's start by transforming how you approach building dynamic and efficient web applications."]}],[{"i":"installing-net-8-and-aspnet-8","l":"Installing .NET 8 and ASP.NET 8","p":["This page will instruct you how to download and install the .NET 7 SDK, including ASP.NET 8 Web API.","First, download the .NET SDK on your computer."]},{"l":"Installing the SDK for .NET 8","p":["Next, install the .NET SDK on your computer.","Next, open a terminal such as PowerShell, Command Prompt, or bash.
